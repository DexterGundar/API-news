Hello!
To use this REPO please create your own files called .env.test with: PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
and .env.development with: PGDATABASE=nc_news.
These files should be created in the main project folder.
The files have been added to .gitignore already, however please double check that they are still there.



Thank you.
